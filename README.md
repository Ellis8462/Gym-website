## 1. UX


### Project Goals

#### User

Allows clients or potenial clients to view information about the gym on the web. This allows users to find information such as membership types, scheduling, location and etc. Users can pay for a membership from one of the options presented to them on the website. Paying online saves travel cost of traveling to the gym directly to pay.

Different users will be looking for the same or different goals when visiting the website. The most important infomation on the page will be at the top so users can see it first when navigating. The website will help inspire and motivate users to join the gym and to start or continue their fitness journey. Having a website that is easy to use will help older demographics who might have less experience on the internet. It targets any demographic because health and fitness is important to all. Users will start on the index.html which is the homepage, from there they can navigate around the website and can go onto other pages such as contact.html which dedicates the entire page with the information they are looking for.


#### Site owner

Our goal is to promote health and fitness and help people improve their physical and mental health by helping users join the gym. 

As a result of this goal, we will provide a website that looks visually appealing and easy navigation to catch the users eye. Doing this will help the user to understand the benefits of joining the gym and learning information about it.
