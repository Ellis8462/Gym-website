PureHealth Gym

## 1. UX


### Project Goals

#### Project purpose 

The purpose of this project is to create a website that helps provide important information that the local gym offers. Having a gym website allows clients to engage with gym services online which makes it more accessible for users. Having the information on the website also allows potential members that want to know more information before paying for a membership. The design and features on the website will hopefully attract customers to the gym. It makes it easier for users to find what they want to instead of ringing up or visiting the gym which is why navigating the website is quicker.


#### **User goals** ####

Allows clients or potential clients to view information about the gym on the web. This allows users to find information such as membership types, scheduling, location and etc. Users can pay for a membership from one of the options presented to them on the website. Paying online saves travel cost of traveling to the gym directly to pay.

Different users will be looking for the same or different goals when visiting the website. The most important information on the page will be at the top so users can see it first when navigating. The website will help inspire and motivate users to join the gym and to start or continue their fitness journey. Having a website that is easy to use will help older demographics who might have less experience on the internet. It targets any demographic because health and fitness is important to all demographics. Users will start on the index.html which is the homepage, from there they can navigate around the website and can go onto other pages such as contact.html which dedicates the entire page with the information they are looking for.



#### **Site owner goals** ####

The goal is to promote health and fitness and help people improve their physical and mental health by helping users join the gym for the locals. 

As a result of this goal, we will provide a website that looks visually appealing and easy navigation to catch the users eye. Doing this will help the user to understand the benefits of joining the gym and learning information about it.


## User stories

### User 

**User story 1: As a gym member I would like to:**

* Find out what times classes are on.
* Book a personal training session.
* Follow for updates on social media.


**User story 2: As a potenial member I would like to:**

* Look for a variety of membership types.
* See photos of the gym and the enviroment.
* Contact the gym for more information.
* Find the location.
* See what the gym offers.



### Research

**Reviewing other gym websites**

I looked at other well known gym websites to see what features their site others and how their design is. I added features that I thought would be good for my website such as a hero image which mostly every website I came across had. All these websites were very eye catching when viewing them with amazing design.

**Websites I visited**
* [AnytimeFitness](https://www.anytimefitness.co.uk/) 
* [Everlast gyms](https://www.everlastgyms.com/) 
* [Pumpgyms](https://www.pumpgyms.com/watfordtolpitslane/) 

## 2. Design


### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq Wireframes to help structure the wireframes before and during the design of the website. This helped me plan the design of the website by helping me apply the layout and the navigation. Using the software is good for designing layouts on different devices so that I can implement them later on.

### Website Structure

The website is made to be a simple structure that enables users to easily navigate around. I wanted the user to find the information they wanted to with the least amount of clicks. 
The most important information will be at the top of the page so that the user sees it first.

The site has a structure of 5 pages and 2 sub pages:


- Homepage - This is the first page the users will see and the page is about what the gym offers, location with interative map and gym opening times.

- Membership - This webpage can be clicked from the navbar link or membership card on the homepage. This page gives information on the membership types.

- Contact - This page can be clicked from the navbar link or personal training card on the homepage. This page allows the user to contact the gym with email or phone.
    - Success page - This page is for the contact page when you complete the form. The page tells the user that their form has been sent through.

- Gallery - This page can be clicked from the navbar link or facility card on the homepage. This page is where images of the gym are stored.

- Classes - This page can be clicked on from the navbar or the classes card on the homepage. Gives the user more information on classes.





### Colours

For my colours, I wanted the main colours to be purple but decided that it would better and easier to see the text with a type of dark gray. For my secondary colour I chose a lighter gray which goes well with my main colour. Both colours makes it easier to see white text so that the text doesn't blend in with the background. For my accent colours I decided to make that a purple colour which was orignally going to be my main colour. The purple makes interactive features stand out such as buttons and links. Hovering effect will be a a darker shade of purple with white text.

![primary-color](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d27955f-9de5-49e3-bda3-b04557cc494a)![secondary-color](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2559f75-1315-438a-a0af-f9ce80a8d005) ![Website-Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-12-31 221330.png)](<assets/Website-Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-12-31 221330.png>)
### Fonts

For my fonts I imported fonts from Google fonts. I used the font Bungee for headings because this font makes it stand out and clear to read. For the body text I decided to use Markazi and for navbar links I used system-ui, -apple-system.

## 5. Testing & Bugs



### HTML validation

To test my html code validation I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  by direct input. This let's me see what errors I have such as unwanted elements.

<details>
<summary> index.html </summary>

Removed the extra div

<img src="assets/Website-Screenshots/indexvalidator.png">


</details>

<details>
<summary> membership.html </summary>


There were errors on my cards and fixed this by removing the div elements for my prices and removing the h3 from the prices which were making it have a child element. I fixed this by putting the h3 element closing tag before the start of the prices. I also added a h4 to the prices and tested the code again and came back with no errors.

<img src="assets/Website-Screenshots/membershipvalidator.png">

Fix

<details>
<summary> contact.html </summary>


Couple of minor issues which I removed when testing the contact page in validator.

### CSS validation

I copied my style.css code into the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and this will show me if I have any coding errors in my css file.

<details>
<summary> style.css </summary>

<img src="assets/Website-Screenshots/cssvalidator.png">

</details>


### Accessibility

I used the Wave accessibilty evaluation tool to test if my website is accessible. I picked up some issues when testing the pages.


**incorrect semantic structure**
<details>
<summary> Screenshot </summary>

<img src="assets/Website-Screenshots/membershipwave.png">

</details>

<br>
I fixed this and changed the h5 on the membership cards to a h3 to make it in the right order.

<br>

**Unerlined text**

<details>
<summary> Screenshot </summary>

<img src="assets/Website-Screenshots/contactwave.png">

</details>
<br>

This was a error that showed up on the contact page and explained that underlined text indicates linked text. I fixed this by removing the underline in html.
<br>

**ARIA label**



This error didn't show up on the Wave accessibilty evaluation tool but I seen an error on my ARIA label tags for my "Call Us" button on the membership page which has the wrong text in it and was the same ARIA label as the "Join Now" hero button. I fixed this by going into html contact page and changed it to match the action of the button.


**Contrast** 

I had some contrast errors with the purple on the buttons. I fixed this by changing the purple colour to a slightly darker shade of purple.

### Performance using Lighthouse

I used lighthouse to test my website performance throughout the project. Lighthouse enables me to get reports back on suggestions for improvements. This enables me to make the website load faster on mobile and desktop.


**Results**

### Testing on different devices



### Bugs during development and fixes


**Hero text**

When adding my hero text it would blend into the background image therefore making it hard to see. To fix this I looked at the batala_bangor website that was sent to me by a mentor for a example of a project. I seen that they too used a white text for the hero image and seen how they used a linear gradient to make their text stand out from the image. I searched online to see how I could implement this code and came across w3schools.com. On the website I found the linear gradient on CSS functions. This fixed the white text that was blending into the background.


**Card size on different devices**

Noticed on chrome dev tools that when changing the screen sizes, the cards border would get wider but the card didn't. I first tried changing it in CSS but then went to the index.html page and changed the col size to a lower number on large screens.

**Card layout on screens 1400px and above**

I wanted the cards on the What we offer section to all fit on the same row but the fourth one would go underneath. I looked at my code and changed both the cards on the left and right side and made them col-xxl-2 instead of 3 which made all cards stay on the same row.

**Images causing bad performance**

I was struggling with website performance with my images for a while. I spoke to student mentor and found out the images where to big and the wrong image format. I fixed this my resizing the images for different device breakpoints and converted them to a Webp file.
