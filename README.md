Strategy- Business Goals

## What are the tech considerations?

This project will be a mobile first approach which is making sure the website looks good for mobile users first. Creating a website mobile first is important because most users use their phones now days to access the internet which is why it is a priority. More people have phones then they do desktops. Making it simple allows the user to find and get to where they need to be quicker so that they don't get frustrated from trying to find information about the gym. 


## Why are we special?

1. We prioritize how a user navigates around the website such as keeping it simple and not too complex to cater towards people that don't use the internet much such as the older generation. Making it too complex can overwhelm the user.
2. We make sure that the website is accessible on most devices and that it adapts to most screen sizes which makes sure that the user has the best experience viewing and navigating the website.
3. Having features that the user can interact with such as different CSS effects like hovering over a element and what happens to elements you click on.
4. It is a website that caters to all demographic types.


## Why would a user want this?

1. A design that is visually appealing and not cluttered with information.
2. Accessible on most devices which helps the users navigation no matter on what device they are on.
3. Easy to understand with great navigation so that the user can find what they want to.
