PureHealth Gym

## 1. UX


### Project Goals

#### Project purpose 

The purpose of this project is to create a website that helps provide important information that the local gym offers. Having a gym website allows clients to engage with gym services online which makes it more accessible for the users. Having the information on the website also allows potenial members that want to know more information before paying for a membership. The design and features on the website will hopefully attract customers to the gym. It makes it easier for users to find what they want to instead of ringing up or visiting the gym which is why navigating the website is quicker.


#### **User goals** ####

Allows clients or potenial clients to view information about the gym on the web. This allows users to find information such as membership types, scheduling, location and etc. Users can pay for a membership from one of the options presented to them on the website. Paying online saves travel cost of traveling to the gym directly to pay.

Different users will be looking for the same or different goals when visiting the website. The most important infomation on the page will be at the top so users can see it first when navigating. The website will help inspire and motivate users to join the gym and to start or continue their fitness journey. Having a website that is easy to use will help older demographics who might have less experience on the internet. It targets any demographic because health and fitness is important to all. Users will start on the index.html which is the homepage, from there they can navigate around the website and can go onto other pages such as contact.html which dedicates the entire page with the information they are looking for.



#### **Site owner goals** ####

Our goal is to promote health and fitness and help people improve their physical and mental health by helping users join the gym for the locals. 

As a result of this goal, we will provide a website that looks visually appealing and easy navigation to catch the users eye. Doing this will help the user to understand the benefits of joining the gym and learning information about it.


## User stories

### User 

**User story 1: As a gym member I would like to:**

* Find out what times classes are on.
* Book a personal training session.
* Follow for updates on social media.


**User story 2: As a potenial member I would like to:**

* Look for a variety of membership types.
* See photos of the gym and the enviroment.
* Contact the gym for more information.
* Find the location.
* See what the gym offers.

Understanding what users want helps me build and structure the website around them.

## 2. Design


### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq Wireframes to help structure the wireframes before and during the design of the website. This helped me plan the design of the website by helping me apply the layout and the navigation. Using the software is good for designing layouts on different devices so that I can implement them later on.

### Colours

For my colours, I wanted the main colours to be purple but decided that it would better and easier to see the text with a type of dark gray. For my secondary colour I chose a lighter gray which goes well with my main colour. Both colours makes it easier to see white text so that the text doesn't blend in with the background. For my accent colours I decided to make that a purple color which was orignally going to be my main colour. The purple makes interactive features stand out such as buttons and links. Hovering effect will be a a darker shade of purple with white text.

### Fonts

For my fonts I imported fonts from Google fonts. I used the font Bungee for headings because this font makes it stand out and clear to read. For the body text I decided to use Markazi and for navbar links I used system-ui, -apple-system.

### Bugs during development and fixes

**Hero text**

When adding my hero text it would blend into the background image therefore making it hard to see. To fix this I looked at the batala_bangor website that was sent to me by a mentor for a example of a project. I seen that they too used a white text for the hero image and seen how they used a linear gradient to make their text stand out from the image. I searched online to see how I could implement this code and came across w3schools.com. On the website I found the linear gradient on CSS functions. This fixed the white text that was blending into the background.


**Card size on different devices**

Noticed on chrome dev tools that when changing the screen sizes, the cards border would get wider but the card didn't. I first tried changing it in CSS but then went to the index.html page and changed the col size to a lower number on large screens.

**Card layout on screens 1400px and above**

i wanted the cards on the What we offer section to all fit on the same row but the fourth one would go underneath. I looked at my code and changed both the cards on the left and right side and made them col-xxl-2 instead of 3 which made all cards stay on the same row.
